        This initial release provides basic support for generating BPEL processes from a choreography
        
        description. Subsequent releases will also provide conformance checking, to ensure that changes
        
        to a BPEL process are validated to ensure the process remains conformant with the choreography.

          When the choreography description has been completed, and has no errors, the user should select
          
          the "SAVARA-&gt;Generate-&gt;Service" menu item from the popup menu associated with the choreography
          
          description (.cdm) file.

          When the dialog window is displayed, it will contain the list of services that can be generated,
          
          along with the project names that will be created, and the target service type for each.
          
          The user can unselect the services they do not
          
          wish to generate (also using the 'Check All' or 'Clear All' buttons).

        <title>Limitations with the current CDL to BPEL mapping</title>
        <para>
          This initial version of the BPEL generation is primarily targeted at generating the interactions
          
          and grouping constructs. These are the important components that will be required when doing
          
          conformance checking as part of the next milestone.

        <para>
          This means that assignments and conditional expressions are not currently generated. The 'when'
          
          construct in CDL (also known as the blocking workunit) is also not currently handled. This may possible
          
          be implemented using flow links.
